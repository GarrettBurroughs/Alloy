# CORE

This is where all the base functionality and components are located. 

The intent of Alloy is to be Multi-Platform (FTC aswell as FRC), so everything in core 
was designed to be the very base components of a robot and should then be implemented in the respective
FTC and FRC folders.

Currently only FTC is being implemented, so most of the stuff in CORE is mostly for future proofing
