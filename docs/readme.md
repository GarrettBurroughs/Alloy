## What is alloy

Alloy is a robot framework that redesigns how robot functionality is coded, allowing for more complex systems, while also abstracting 
more advanced functionality allowing for easier implementation.

The goal of Alloy is to provide a robot framework that allows anyone, including new programmers, to be able to implement
high functioning and quality code for their robots. In other terms, Alloy aims to prevent robot code from being a limiting
factor on the performance of the robot.


Alloy is a robot framework designed specifically for the First Tech Challenge (FTC), but is also designed
with expandibility in mind. FRC implementation is possible and will be coming in the future.

Alloy is based off the FRC robot framework [Sprocket](https://github.com/MontclairRobotics/Sprocket), but redesigned to abstract away the more complex ideas but still allow for advanced robot functionality.

Any information regarding Alloy, including how it works, project structure, as well as in-depth explanation on how to use all of the components
can be found in the project [Wiki](https://github.com/GarrettBurroughs/Alloy/wiki) as well as a [quick start guide](https://github.com/GarrettBurroughs/Alloy/wiki/Getting-Started).

## Essentials


## Wiki

The Wiki contains a large amount of information, examples, 
tutorials and explanations about creating a robot with alloy. It
is highly suggested reading it to get the most out of alloy as possible
