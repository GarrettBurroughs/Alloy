Status: **Beta**


Alloy is a robot framework designed specifically for the First Tech Challenge (FTC).

Alloy is based off the FRC robot framework [Sprocket](https://github.com/MontclairRobotics/Sprocket), but redesigned to abstract away the more complex ideas but still allow for advanced robot functionality.
